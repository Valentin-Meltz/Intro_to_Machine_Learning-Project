# Machine Learning Project: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of both **supervised** and **unsupervised learning** techniques on two different datasets. The goal is to showcase the diversity of machine learning methodologies and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.

### Datasets Used

1. **Gym Data Exercise**  
   This dataset contains information about different gym exercises. It is used for unsupervised learning tasks like clustering and identifying patterns in the exercises.

2. **Titanic Data Exercise**  
   This dataset provides information about passengers on the Titanic. It is used for supervised learning tasks such as predicting survival rates based on various features.

## Objectives

### Gym Data Exercise (Unsupervised Learning)
- **Goal**: Explore the dataset to find patterns or clusters of similar exercises.
- **Techniques**: 
  - Data preprocessing and feature scaling
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Visualization of clusters

### Titanic Data Exercise (Supervised Learning)
- **Goal**: Predict survival outcomes of Titanic passengers based on their attributes.
- **Techniques**:
  - Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features)
  - Classification models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest
  - Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Tools and Libraries

The project uses the following tools and libraries:
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and model development
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models
- **Kmeans**: For clustering data
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploratory data analysis and model development
